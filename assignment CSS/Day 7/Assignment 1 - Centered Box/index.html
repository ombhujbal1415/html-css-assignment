                <p>The Flexible Box Layout Model (flexbox) is a layout model designed for one-dimensional content. It excels
                    at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

                    This is the ideal layout model for this sidebar pattern. Flexbox not only helps lay the sidebar and
                    content out inline, but where there's not enough space remaining, the sidebar will break onto a new
                    line. </p>
